# Ranged Calendar

Allows user to select dates in range. Click on the same date to single select, a different date to select range. Can be canceled by selecting a date earlier than the start date of the range.

In `App.tsx`, add property currentMonthOnly to limit switching monthes

Use your favorite package manager to install dependencies, `dev` to enter develop mode, `build` to build the code, and `preview` to see the built version.
ex. `npm install`, `npm run dev`, `npm build`, `npm preview`
